# Project_Disaster_Response_Robot
University of Ottawa ELG 4912/4913 Capstone Project

The Disaster Response Robot is a vehicle based device built to scan, map out, and assess hazardous areas which are unideal for human intervention. This project aims to be a viable solution for safe access, assessment, and mitigation of hazardous, risky and dangerous environments and hence foster safety and efficiency in disaster response.

The goal behind the project idea is to send the disaster robot in prior to human involvement acting as a first responder. The robot will then pressure the set area mapping and localizing all hazardous areas. The operator of the vehicle will be able to see multiple feeds (i.e. live camera view, 3D/2D Lidar map localization and a thermal imaging map). This allows responders to gain useful information about the area they are about to engage in.
